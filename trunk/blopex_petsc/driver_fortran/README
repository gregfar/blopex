This software was produced as part of work done by the U.S. Government, and is
not subject to copyright in the United States.

PETSc must be configured with BLOPEX.  When you run PETSc's configure.py,
include the flag --download-blopex=1

Files:

makefile - the Unix makefile to compile the program.  You must edit this file
   to set the name of your compiler, location of include files and libraries,
   etc.  Instructions are in the file.

ex2f_blopex.F - a modified version of the Fortran example ex2f.F from the PETSc
   source distribution (Version 2.3.3-p4) that illustrates a way of using
   BLOPEX with PETSc from Fortran.  Modifications are marked with WFM.

blopex_c.F90 - the C routines that interface between the Fortran routines and
   the BLOPEX code.  You may need to change a macro at the beginning of it
   depending on what name mangling scheme your Fortran compiler uses, but for
   the most part it can be used as is.
