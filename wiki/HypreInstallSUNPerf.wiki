#summary Hypre install with SUN compilers, obsolete

= Introduction =

Hypre installation using SUN compilers and libraries. This information is obsolete, since it refers to hypre and SUN versions from 2005. 


= Details =
<pre>
To build hypre-1.9 for 64 bit with sunperf:

./configure --with-CC="mpcc -xarch=native64" --with-F77="mpf77 -xarch=native64" --with-CXX="mpCC -xarch=native64" --with-blas-libs="sunperf sunmath m" --with-lapack-libs="sunpef sunmath m"

make 
cd test

make -i


(some executables won't be compiled because of the errors in the configurator. However, ij_es, struct_es, sstruct_es should compile.)

you can then run things with

mprun -np 6 ./ij -lobpcg


to build hypre-1.9 for 64 bit with hypre's blas/lapack:

./configure --with-CC="mpcc -xarch=native64" --with-F77="mpf77 -xarch=native64" --with-CXX="mpCC -xarch=native64"


Typical mathsun interactive run:

mprun -np 6 ./ij -lobpcg -n 100 100 100 -pcgitr 0 -vrand 27


Typical mathsun non-interactive run:

nohup mprun -np 6 ./ij -lobpcg -n 100 100 100 -pcgitr 0 -vrand 270 > 270.out < /dev/null &
