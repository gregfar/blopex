#summary Knyazev's former group at UC Denver

We are working on preconditioned solvers for eigenvalue and singular value problems: develop corresponding software, work on the theoretical issues, and contribute to applications.

[[Gross cluster]] is used as a test supercomputer, to debug the codes and run test examples. 

==Current status==
The group leader, Andrew Knyazev, has moved to [http://www.merl.com MERL] as of Fall 2012.

==Major results==
* The [[BLOPEX]] software has been developed for solving eigenvalue problems

==Members==
