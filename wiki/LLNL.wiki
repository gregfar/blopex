#summary Specifics of LLNL configure and testing

= Introduction =

Rico has (and Andrew should have) accounts on LLNL machines: ATLAS, ZEUS, YANA.
Here we describe the specifics of LLNL configure and testing. 

= Details =

According to https://computing.llnl.gov/?set=resources&page=OCF_resources ATLAS, ZEUS, YANA all are essentially the same hardware (dual core AMD opteron Proc 8216) with 64 bit memory addressing. Each node has 8 CPUs and 16 GB of RAM (32 GB for yana60-79). They all run CHAOS linux which is the LLNL version of redhat. 

 * ATLAS     1152 nodes, high speed interconnect
 * ZEUS      288 nodes, high speed interconnect
 * YANA      80 nodes, no high speed interconnect

Here is a typical msub script for a batch job (msub tst3.sh)

<pre>
#!/bin/csh
#MSUB -l nodes=8
#MSUB -l walltime=25:00
#MSUB -q pbatch
#MSUB -m be
#MSUB -V
#MSUB -o tst.out
#MSUB -A asccasc
##### These are shell commands
date
srun -n64  ./ij -lobpcg -n 150 150 150 -pcgitr 0 -vrand 20 -seed 1
echo 'Done'
