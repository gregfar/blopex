#summary Documentation needed for our PETSc test drivers

= Introduction =

Our PETSc test drivers are very poorly documented. 
To such an extreme that it is in some cases impossible to conclude from their 
results if they actually work. 
Let us provide the description of the drivers here, to be added to the headers 
of the c codes and/or readme files later.
