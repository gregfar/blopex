#summary Installing and testing the development versions of PETSc and SLEPc.

= Introduction =

BLOPEX is currently being in the process of move from PETSc to SLEPc. The SLEPc BLOPEX install needs to be tested. 

Currently, the development versions of PETSc and SLEPc need to be used to test the latest BLOPEX in SLEPc. 

= Installing the development versions of PETSc (without BLOPEX) =

Follow http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/developers/index.html#Obtaining

For configure, use the usual options that need to be tested. DO NOT install BLOPEX with PETSc. After configure, compile as usual. During the PETSc installation, you must have set up both PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH enviroment variables. They are needed in the next step, the SLEPc installation. 

= Installing the development versions of SLEPc with BLOPEX =

According to http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc/download/download.htm, run
{{{
svn checkout http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc/svn/trunk slepc-dev
}}}
e.g., in the same directory where the newly created petsc-dev directory is located. At a later time, the repository can be refreshed simply by:
{{{
svn update
}}}

As suggested at http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc/documentation/instal.htm execute 
{{{
cd slepc-dev/
export SLEPC_DIR=$PWD
./configure --download-blopex 
make
make test
}}}

The SLEPc configure reads PETSc configure parameters using PETSC_DIR, so PETSc configure must be executed first, as in the previous step. 

= Running SLEPc examples with BLOPEX =

BLOPEX-compatible SLEPc examples are listed at 
http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc/documentation/current/src/examples/index.html
and are located in src/eps/examples/tutorials . BLOPEX-compatible SLEPc examples are 1-4, 7, 11, and 19. To use BLOPEX in any BLOPEX-compatible SLEPc example, simply add "-eps_type blopex" to the command line. In order to call hypre preconditioning, add also -"st_pc_type hypre -st_pc_hypre_type boomeramg" assuming that PETSc has been configured with hypre. The option "-st_ksp_type preonly" is currently (July 17, 2011) the only available. Other useful options, e.g., most importantly, "-st_ksp_type cg" are not yet supported.


{{{
./ex19 -eps_type blopex -st_pc_type hypre -st_pc_hypre_type boomeramg -da_grid_x 100 -da_grid_y 100 -da_grid_z 100  
}}}

PETSc command-line options supported, e.g., "-log_summary"
