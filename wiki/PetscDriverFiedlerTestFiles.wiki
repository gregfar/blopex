#summary Petsc driver_fiedler test files

For Petsc testing with driver_fiedler the following files are available.

File names containing "complex" are for complex scalars, with "double" are for real scalars.

File names containinng "_64" are for 64bit integers, otherwise they are for 32bit integers.

It is important to match the files to the Petsc configuration for scalar and integer size. 

The file formats are different for each combination.

After each description typical results are shown.


*Files with suffix of -complex.petsc, -double.petsc, -complex_64.petsc, -double_64.petsc*

_Developer Notes:_  These files were original to ver 1.0 of Blopex. They were uploaded to Matlab and used to create the complex and 64bit versions.
