#summary Testing BLOPEX in the latest released PETSc/SLEPc

= Introduction =

BLOPEX has been moved from PETSc to SLEPc. The SLEPc BLOPEX install needs to be tested. This applies to PETSc and SLEPC both revision 3.2. 

= Installation =

Install PETSc revision 3.2 and then SLEPC revision 3.2 according to the instructions from http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/documentation/installation.html and http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc/documentation/instal.htm

In the SLEPc installation, use
{{{
./configure --download-blopex 
}}}

= Testing procedures = 

SLEPCs's make test and make alltest pick up from the SLEPSc configure if --download-blopex has been used, and if so, run BLOPEX tests. If everything runs correctly, make test should produce no errors, while make alltest should not produce any output at all, ideally.
