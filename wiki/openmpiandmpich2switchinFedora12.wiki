How to setup openmpi or mpich2 in Fedora12

= Introduction =

openmpi and mpich2 are the two currently most popular MPI software. 
They cannot be mixed, only one of them must be used at a time. 
How to switch from one to another? 
The info below is copied from http://osdir.com/ml/fedora-list/2009-12/msg00591.html

= Details =

Check which packages are installed by running: 

rpm -q openmpi

rpm -q openmpi-devel

rpm -q mpich2

rpm -q mpich2-devel

If any of these 4 packages are missing, install them first, e.g., 

yum install openmpi

(need to be root for this)

The management is done on user-level on a session basis.
To use the openmpi compiler, just run

module load openmpi-x86_64

on x86_64 and

module load openmpi-i686

on x86 to get Open MPI working again.

If you have Open MPI support loaded, you can also get rid of it with

module unload openmpi-x86_64

and switch to MPICH2 with

module load mpich2-x86_64

Double-ckeck by running

which mpicc

which mpiCC

to make sure that they refer to the same MPI. 


Remember that this setup is only active in the given shell window till you close it. 
Make sure that you name differently the directories where you compile and run the 
codes. Do not forget to setup the MPI again if you return to the previously compiled 
code before you run it! 

PS. RHEL 4 and 5 use the mpi-selector command instead.
